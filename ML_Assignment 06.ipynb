    "3. Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, leading to poor performance on the test data. Overfitting is often caused by using a model that is too complex or by using too many features or too much data.\n",
    "4. To identify whether a model is underfitting or overfitting, you can examine its performance on the training and test data. If the model performs poorly on both the training and test data, it is likely underfitting. If the model performs well on the training data but poorly on the test data, it is likely overfitting.\n",
    "5. To address underfitting, you can use a more complex model, add more features, or use more data. To address overfitting, you can use a simpler model, reduce the number of features, or use regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization to penalize complex models.\n",

    "- <b>Bootstrapping vs cross-validation</b>\n",
    "1. Bootstrapping and cross-validation are two commonly used resampling techniques in machine learning and statistics.\n",
    "2. Bootstrapping is a resampling technique that involves generating multiple datasets by randomly sampling with replacement from the original dataset. This process creates datasets that are similar but not identical to the original dataset. Each of these datasets is used to train and test a model, and the results are averaged to provide an estimate of the model's performance.\n",
    "3. Cross-validation is a resampling technique that involves partitioning the original dataset into multiple subsets, or folds, of approximately equal size. One fold is used as the test set, while the remaining folds are used as the training set. The process is repeated multiple times, with each fold used as the test set once. The results are averaged to provide an estimate of the model's performance.\n",
    "4. The main difference between bootstrapping and cross-validation is that bootstrapping involves randomly sampling with replacement from the original dataset to create multiple datasets, while cross-validation involves partitioning the original dataset into multiple subsets.\n",
    "5. Bootstrapping is useful when the dataset is small or the model is complex, as it can help to reduce the variance in the model's performance estimates. Cross-validation is useful when the dataset is large or the model is simple, as it can help to reduce the bias in the model's performance estimates."
