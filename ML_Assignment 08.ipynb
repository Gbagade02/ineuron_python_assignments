In such cases, feature construction is necessary to create new features that can capture important information about the data.\n",

For each data point, the binary variable corresponding to the category of the nominal variable is set to 1, while the others are set to 0.

    "1. Equal width binning: In equal width binning, the range of the variable is divided into a fixed number of equally sized bins. For example, if we have a numeric variable \"age\" with values ranging from 18 to 80, and we want to divide it into 4 bins, we would create bins of width (80-18)/4 = 15.5. The resulting bins would be [18, 33.5), [33.5, 49), [49, 64.5), and [64.5, 80].\n",

This is useful when the distribution of the variable is skewed, and we want to ensure that each bin contains representative data points. For example, if we have a numeric variable \"income\" with a skewed distribution, we might use equal frequency binning to create bins such that each bin contains an equal number of people with similar incomes.\n",

Each data point is assigned to the bin that corresponds to its value, and the resulting categorical variable can be used as input to machine learning algorithms.
